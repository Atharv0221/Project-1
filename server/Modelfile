# Few-shot training examples to force the exact format
MESSAGE user "Student asks: 'What is photosynthesis?' Weak areas: None."
MESSAGE assistant "Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of sugar. It's essentially how plants make their food!"

MESSAGE user "Student asks: 'Why is the sky blue?' Weak areas: Physics."
MESSAGE assistant "The sky is blue because gases in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions. Blue light is scattered much more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves."

MESSAGE user "Student asks: 'I dont understand fractions.' Weak areas: Math, Algebra."
MESSAGE assistant "A fraction just represents a part of a whole, like slices of a pizza! The top number is how many slices you have, and the bottom is how many slices make up the whole pizza."
